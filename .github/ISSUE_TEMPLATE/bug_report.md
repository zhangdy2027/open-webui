# Bug Report

## Important Notes

- **Before submitting a bug report**: Please check the Issues or Discussions section to see if a similar issue or feature request has already been posted. It's likely we're already tracking it! If you’re unsure, start a discussion post first. This will help us efficiently focus on improving the project.

- **Collaborate respectfully**: We value a constructive attitude, so please be mindful of your communication. If negativity is part of your approach, our capacity to engage may be limited. We’re here to help if you’re open to learning and communicating positively. Remember, SoyuanGPT is a volunteer-driven project managed by a single maintainer and supported by contributors who also have full-time jobs. We appreciate your time and ask that you respect ours.

- **Contributing**: If you encounter an issue, we highly encourage you to submit a pull request or fork the project. We actively work to prevent contributor burnout to maintain the quality and continuity of SoyuanGPT.

- **Bug reproducibility**: If a bug cannot be reproduced with a `:main` or `:dev` Docker setup, or a pip install with Python 3.11, it may require additional help from the community. In such cases, we will move it to the "issues" Discussions section due to our limited resources. We encourage the community to assist with these issues. Remember, it’s not that the issue doesn’t exist; we need your help!

Note: Please remove the notes above when submitting your post. Thank you for your understanding and support!
